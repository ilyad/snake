Minimalistic implementation
of the SNAKE game [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game) ]
for Sinclair ZX Specturm.

To compile the game:
* install Debian package "z80asm"
* execute: ./build.sh

To run the game:
* install Debian package "spectemu-x11"
* start Speccy emulator by "xspect a.sna"
* press ENTER in the emulator to start the game
* control the green snake either by cursor keys or by 5-6-7-8
* collect apples, don't bite yourself or the black screen border

My personal record as of 2015 is 133 apples
